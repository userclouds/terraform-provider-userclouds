# UserClouds Terraform Provider

This provider allows Terraform to configure UserClouds infrastructure. See
example below.

Use the navigation to the left to read about available resources.

## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a declarative Infrastructure-as-Code tool that allows you to
describe how you want your infrastructure to look; then, it compares the live
state of your infrastructure against the vision described in your configuration,
and it applies the necessary changes to make the live state match the desired
state.

## What if I don't want to use Terraform?

We have an open-source tool called
[ucconfig](https://github.com/userclouds/ucconfig) that is layered on top of
this Terraform provider. It is less powerful and flexible than Terraform, but it
makes simple use cases less accessible, and it has very little starting cost.

## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    userclouds = {
      source  = "registry.terraform.io/userclouds/userclouds"
      version = ">= 0.1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Instantiate the provider, configuring via provider attributes
# or via environment variables
provider "userclouds" {
  tenant_url = "https://mytenant.tenant.userclouds.com"
  # Set USERCLOUDS_CLIENT_ID and USERCLOUDS_CLIENT_SECRET
  # environment variables to avoid hardcoding secrets.
  # USERCLOUDS_TENANT_URL may be set in place of tenant_url as
  # well.
}

# Create an example resource
resource "userclouds_userstore_column" "sample" {
  name       = "sample_column"
  type       = "string"
  index_type = "none"
  is_array   = false
}
```
